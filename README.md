**Early Cancer Detection System**


**Overview**


The Early Cancer Detection System is an AI-powered solution designed to detect cancer at early stages using medical images and electronic health records (EHR). This system leverages deep learning techniques, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs) using the EfficientNetB3 architecture, to classify images and identify the type and stage of cancer. Additionally, it assesses patients' risk factors based on their EHR data, alerting healthcare providers for timely intervention and improving patient outcomes.

**Features**
Medical Image Classification: Processes histopathological images, mammograms, and other medical images to detect cancerous tissues.
Risk Assessment: Integrates EHR data, including patient demographics and genomic information, to identify high-risk patients.
Cancer Type & Stage Classification: Provides detailed classification of the cancer type and its stage.
Alert Mechanism: Notifies healthcare providers when a high-risk patient is identified.
Visualization: Generates clear data visualizations for better decision-making by healthcare professionals.
Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python
Deep Learning Framework: TensorFlow, Keras
Pre-trained Model: EfficientNetB3
Data Processing: NumPy, Pandas
Image Processing: OpenCV, ImageDataGenerator
Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn
Other Tools: Scikit-learn, TensorBoard, Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab
**Dataset**
**The system requires:**

Medical Images (e.g., histopathological images, mammograms).
Electronic Health Records (EHRs) that include patient demographics, medical history, and genomic data.

**Challenges We Faced**
While building the system, one of the major hurdles was achieving optimal accuracy. Initially, the model struggled with low accuracy during testing. This was primarily due to limited data, overfitting, and an imbalanced dataset. To address this, we implemented data augmentation techniques like rotation, zooming, and flipping of images. Additionally, we used early stopping and learning rate reduction to improve the generalization of the model.

**Future Opportunities**
Expansion of Dataset: Incorporating additional data types like genomic information and lifestyle attributes for more comprehensive diagnoses.
Advanced Algorithms: Exploring more advanced deep learning algorithms and hybrid models for improved accuracy.
Personalized Medicine: Integrating genomic data to provide personalized treatment plans for patients.
